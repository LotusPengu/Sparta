The four pillars of OOP:
To help promote better code - reusable, extendable, logical structure,
better readability, well organised

Abstraction
- hiding implementation details away from the user

Inheritance
- promotes code reuse by passing down attributes and methods from super classes
to subclasses
- utilises an IS-A relationship, anything that applies to the super class should
apply to the subclass
- when defining characteristics, should ensure that everything in the super class also
relates to the subclasses

Encapsulation
- built on the idea of data hiding
- protect access to data within a class
- data can only be accessed through getter and setter methods (@property methods)

Polymorphism
- poly = many, morph = forms
- a method taking on many forms/functionality acting in two or more different ways
- i.e., the same function being specified in a different part of the hierarchy
